With this large number of roles to fill there are only 1,549 that are eligible to mentor. 

  If we refer to the table below, It shows the count of those eligible for mentorship by current title in the company. The company is losing   the largest amount in the Senior Egineers and yet that title has some of the lowest numbers that are eligible to mentor.

   With these large numbers it looks like it may be a struggle to properly mentor and fill all these positions.
